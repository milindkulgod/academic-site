title = "Detection of Autism with Machine Learning"
+++


For our Undergraduate project, we used Machine Learning to detect Autism in children.

Autism is a very sensitive disorder, and it can not be detected in one go. As it is classified as a spectrum of disorders, there is no specific set of symptoms to define Autism. Screening of Autism is not widely available, and on availability, turns out to be an expensive process.

The objective of the project is to device a cost efficient method to make Autism screening available to everyone, and thus avail treatment at the right time.

The project was developed in Python using the Jupyter Notebook.
The dataset was initially extracted from 
[here] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autism+Screening+Adult by Fadi Fayez Thabtah, Department of Digital Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.

### Data Preproccesing
The initial dataset had a lot of missing values, and the values were substituted with the mean of the entire column. Later, real-time data was collected from Autistic Schools and hospitals on approval from the doctors, and ran the algorithms with the newly obtained data.

The report and the project can be found on the GitHub Repository.
