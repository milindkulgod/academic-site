**Project Idea Proposal:**
<p align="justify>
This project was taken into consideration, to make sure that self help becomes the best help when it comes to health care. Keeping ourselves healthy is something that we should never overlook. If neglected, it can lead to unwanted complications and suffering. So we need to make sure that we're taking the right remedy, the right medicine to cure us from our ailments. For this, the **PharmEazy** Recommender System was brought into life.

One can look for medications based on the reviews given by other people along with the ratings. One can also look up the medications that one will be needing based on the symptoms that one is undergoing. The app will recommend all similar medications for the particular symptom or ailment.

The recommender system will be built on the Kaggle dataset that has been posted by Jessica Li. The dataset can be found here at: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018. The dataset has more than 50,000 entries with 7 attributes for the data.

**Why this idea?**

The internet has taken humanity by storm and has changed the way people live life completely. The smartphone is a catalyst to this revolution. Everyone can afford a smartphone and stay connected to the internet constantly at cost effective prices in India. This can pave the path to know what medications one is supposed to use, accurately and in a safe manner. **PharmEazy** recommendation system is for the people of the world, for the people who do not have immediate access to medical help due to unforeseen circumstances, to keep themselves healthy, fit and live easier in a smarter way. Data mining with machine learning makes this conveniently possible.
