title = "Door Locking System using Arduino and Blynk"+++


A door locking system was created as an IoT Project. The main objective was to have a cost efficient lock for personal spaces like a locker. The locking mechanism was created by connecting a rod to a servo motor. A passcode method of entry was deviced initially, later, the lock was controlled through a smartphone with the help of the Blynk app. All the components were connected to the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
