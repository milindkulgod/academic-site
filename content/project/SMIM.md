### Summary:

The aim of the project was to give an effective and user-friendly way to maintain communication between a set of students and their mentor and have their personal details in order to schedule meetings with their parents if required. The module had login portals for the student and the mentor, where they could login with their respective credentials and communicate with each other through messages, and the admin had the control over the login for both the teacher as well as the student.

The technologies used were HTML5, CSS, PHP, MyPHPAdmin as the backend, Sublime Text for the text editor.
